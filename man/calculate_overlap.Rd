\title{Determines the overlap of predicted HLA binders with transmembrane
helices for all HLA supertypes.}
\usage{
calculate_overlap(
  tmh_9mers_as_data_filename,
  protein_lengths_filename,
  tmh_overlapping_binders_as_data_filename
)
}
\arguments{
\item{tmh_9mers_as_data_filename}{filename to store
per TMH protein, the indices at which it is TMH,
in R data format.
for example `work/tmh.9mers.Rdata`}

length of all proteins in proteome,
for example `work/protein-lengths.txt`}

\item{tmh_overlapping_binders_as_data_filename}{filename to store
per TMH overlapping binders
in R data format.
for example `work/tmh-overlapping-binders.Rdata`}
}
