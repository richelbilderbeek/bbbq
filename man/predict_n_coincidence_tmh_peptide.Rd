\title{Predict the number of n-mers and the number of n-mers
that overlap with at least one amino acid with a TMH
for one peptide.}
\usage{
predict_n_coincidence_tmh_peptide(peptide, n_aas, verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{peptide}{peptide sequence, for example,
\code{ARNDCQEV}}

\item{n_aas}{number of amino acids}

\item{verbose}{set to TRUE for more output}
}
\value{
a tibble with
\enumerate{
  \item n_spots number of spots for the n-mer
  \item n_spots_tmh number of spots that have one
    amino acid overlapping with a TMH
}
}
\description{
Predict the number of n-mers and the number of n-mers
that overlap with at least one amino acid with a TMH
for one peptide.
