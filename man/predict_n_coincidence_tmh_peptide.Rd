\title{Predict the number of n-mers and the number of n-mers
that overlap with at least one amino acid with a TMH
for one peptide.}
\usage{
predict_n_coincidence_tmh_peptide(
  protein_sequence,
  peptide_length,
  verbose = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{protein_sequence}{a protein sequence}

\item{peptide_length}{length of the peptide in amino acids}

\item{verbose}{set to TRUE for more output}
}
\value{
a tibble with
\enumerate{
  \item n_spots number of spots for the n-mer
  \item n_spots_tmh number of spots that have one
    amino acid overlapping with a TMH
}
}
\description{
Predict the number of n-mers and the number of n-mers
